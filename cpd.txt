What have I learnt?

In tuesday's lesson, I have learned about how to use GitHub and Visual Studio Code. Alongside of cloning existing repository from the GitHub browser to the desktop app.
I have also learned about few different learning code website online where I can start and practice about HTML/CSS 


How did I use this in practice?

By exporting the LTU-Reboot folder in visual studio code, editing its content such as the cpd.text and saving my changes so that it can be commited and pushed in GitHub desktop to update it within the browser.
I've also created an account in FreeCodeCamp as well as CodePen to have more practice with coding and get used to its language. 


What did I find hard?

So far, I have not yet find anything too challenging, but I am sure that will soon change!
