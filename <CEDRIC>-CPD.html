 <h4>What have I learnt?</h4>
 
 <p>In tuesday's lesson, I had an introduction to HTML coding and started to learn the basics of it. 
 <br/>
    Such as using :
     <ul>
         <li><strong>strong</strong> elements</li>
         <li>how to <em>emphasis</em> some words.</li>
         <li> Using <a href="https://images.pexels.com/photos/660266/pexels-photo-660266.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=1&w=500" title="A Duck" target="_blank">link</a> to show an image of a duck for example</li>
    </ul>  
I've also learned about how to source and input my own media such an image within my own coding.
 </p> 
 
 <h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4>
 
 <p>We were made to source and input our own desired image inside our own coding process. I have also taken a HTML quiz
    via W3Schools Online Certification to which you can fin the results there ---></p>

 <h4>What did I find hard?</h4>
 
 <p>I am still trying to get my head around the whole concept of coding and it can be quite fast sometime but I am enjoying it so far.</p>
