 <h4>What have I learnt?</h4>
 
 <p style="color: red;">In today's lesson, we've been learning and practicing about :</p> 
 <br/>
    
     <ul>
         <li><strong>Float</strong> </li>
         <li><strong>Clearfix</strong></li>
         <li> <strong>Framework</strong></li>
    </ul>  
 <br/>
 
 <h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4>
 
 <p>We've worked on the task 2.4.5 on how to work out floating elements and been shown how to use framework CSS style sheet such as Bootstrap Template to have pre made code that we can use in our website</p>
<br/> 
 
 
 <h4>What did I find hard?</h4>
 I am still trying to get my head around how positioning element work and how to refer and include my CSS style sheet into my HTML page.
