 <h4>What have I learnt?</h4>

  I have also learned about few different learning code website online where I can start and practice about HTML/CSS </p> 
 
 
 <h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4>
 
 <p>By exporting the LTU-Reboot folder in visual studio code, editing its content such as the cpd.text and saving my changes so that it can be commited and pushed in GitHub desktop to update it within the browser.
  I've also created an account in FreeCodeCamp as well as CodePen to have more practice with coding and get used to its language.</p>
